# ABSTRACT: Sane APIs for IP addresses and networks

__END__

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<NetAddr::IP> module is very complete, correct, and useful. However, its
API design is a bit crufty. This distro provides an alternative API that aims
to address the biggest problems with that module's API, as well as adding some
additional features.

This distro contains two modules, L<Net::Works::Address> and
L<Net::Works::Network>.

B<NOTE: This distro's APIs are still in flux. Use at your own risk.>

=head1 Net::Works VERSUS NetAddr::IP

Here are some of the key differences between the two distributions:

=over 4

=item * Separation of address from network

C<Net::Works> provides two classes, one for single IP addresses and one for
networks (and subnets). With L<NetAddr::IP> a single address is represented as
a /32 or /128 subnet. This is technically correct but can make the API harder
to use. Whenever you want a single IP you're always stuck checking that the
object you're working with is the size of a single address subnet.

=item * Multiple constructors

L<Net::Works> allows you to construct an IP address from a string ("192.0.2.1")
or an integer (3221225985) using separate constructors.

=item * Next & previous IP

You can get the next and previous address from L<Net::Works::Address> object,
regardless of whether or not that address is in the same subnet.

=item * Constructors throw exceptions

If you pass bad data to a constructor you'll get an exception.

=item * Sane iterator and first/last

The iterator provided by L<Net::Works::Network> has no confusing special
cases. It always returns all the addresses in a network, including the network
and broadcast addresses. Similarly, the C<< $network->first() >> and C<<
$network->last() >> do not return different results for different sized networks.

=item * Split a range into subnets

The L<Net::Works::Network> class provides a C<<
Net::Works::Network->range_as_subnets >> method that takes a start and end IP
address and splits this into a set of subnets that include all addresses in
the range.

=item * Does less

This distro does not support every method provided by L<NetAddr::IP>. Patches
to add more features are welcome, however.
